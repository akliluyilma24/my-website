    <p> African Americans are a big part of our community today. but they had to go through alot just to be able to drink the same water as everyone else. this website is a site that will show you what happened to african americans from africa hundreds of years ago to america now</p>
<p>before the afican americans were colonized, almost all of them lived in Africa, "prior to European colonialism, it is estimated that Africa had up to 10,000 different states and autonomous groups with distinct languages and customs" these people lived there for tens of hundreds of years and it was also beleived that africa was where the first humans ever lived, with fossils dating back from 2 million years ago."Egypt was the first of many great African civilisations. It lasted thousands of years and achieved many magnificent and incredible things in the fields of science, mathematics, medicine, technology and the arts. Egyptian civilisation was already over 2000 years old by the time the city of Rome was built."</p>
<p>Most europeans were very racist and thought african americans were lesser than them, so they thought african history was not important. this was used to justify slavery. But in reality african history is a very intersting thing and was looked down upon.
